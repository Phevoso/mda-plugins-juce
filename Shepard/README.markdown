# Shepard

Shepard tone generator

This plug-in generates a continuously rising or falling tone.  Or rather, that's what it sounds like but really new harmonics are always appearing at one end of the spectrum and disappearing at the other. (Using some EQ can improve the psychoacoustic effect, depending on your listening environment.)

These continuous tones are actually called "Risset tones", developed from the earlier "Shepard tones" which change in series of discrete steps. The Mode control allows the input signal to be mixed or ring modulated with the tone - this works well as one element of a complex chain of effects.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Mode| TONES = tones only, RING MOD = input ring modulated by tones, TONES+IN = tones mixed with input |
| Rate | Speed of rising (right) or falling (left) |
| Output | Level trim |
