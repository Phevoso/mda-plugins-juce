# RingMod

This was the first "mda" effect, made way back in 1998.  It is a simple ring modulator, multiplying the input signal by a sine wave, the frequency of which is set using the Frequency and Fine Tune controls.  As if ring modulation wasn't harsh enough already, the Feedback parameter can add even more edge to the sound!

Can be used as a high-frequency enhancer for drum sounds (when mixed with the original), adding dissonance to pitched material, and severe tremolo (at low frequency settings).

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Freq | Set oscillator frequency in 100Hz steps |
| Fine | Oscillator frequency fine tune |
| Feedback | Amount of feedback for "harsh" sound |
