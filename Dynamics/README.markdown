# Dynamics

Modern-sounding Compressor / Limiter / Gate with low processor usage

This plug-in is a very ordinary analog-style compressor and noise gate, designed to sound like the dynamics section from a large- format mixer.  A peak limiter is preset to 0 dB FS (the compressor release time parameter also sets the limiter release).

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Threshold |   |
| Ratio | Very wide range allows "overcompression" where output gets quieter as input gets louder |
| Output | Level trim |
| Attack |   |
| Release |   |
| Limiter | Limiter threshold - the limiter has zero attack time but uses the same release time as the compressor |
| Gate Thresh |   |
| Gate Attack |   |
| Gate Release |   |
