# Degrade

This plug-in reduces the bit-depth and sample rate of the input audio (using the Quantize and Sample Rate parameters) and has some other features for attaining the sound of vintage digital hardware.  The headroom control is a peak clipper, and the Non-Linearity controls add some harmonic distortion to thicken the sound.  Post Filter is a low-pass filter to remove some of the grit introduced by the other controls.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Headroom | Peak clipping threshold |
| Quantize | Bit depth (typically 8 or below for "telephone" quality) |
| Sample Rate | Reduced sample rate |
| Sample Mode | Sample or Hold for different sound characters |
| Post Filter | Low-pass filter to muffle the distortion produced by the previous controls |
| Non-Linearity | Additional harmonic distortion "thickening" |
| Non-Linear Mode | Odd or Even for different sound characters |
| Output | Level trim |
